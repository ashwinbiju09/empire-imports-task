# Empire Imports – Medusa Storefront Product Page Redesign

## Key Changes Implemented

1. **Breadcrumb Navigation**  
   Added breadcrumb navigation at the top to improve usability and provide users with a clear sense of location and navigation hierarchy.

2. **Product Image Placement (Left-Aligned)**  
   Positioned the main product image on the left side to align with natural left-to-right scanning behavior, enhancing product evaluation and comfort.

3. **Action Area Visibility (“Above the Fold”)**  
   Ensured key elements such as the product image, title, description, price, and Add to Cart button are visible within the initial viewport to improve conversion.

4. **Bold Title and Pricing**  
   Made the product title and price bold and visually prominent to enhance visual hierarchy and improve decision-making speed.

5. **High-Contrast “Add to Cart” Button (Blue)**  
   Used a high-contrast blue for the Add to Cart button to increase visibility and conversion rates, leveraging color psychology and contrast principles.

6. **Structured Product Information & Shipping/Returns**  
   Grouped product details and shipping/returns into distinct sections to improve readability, reduce cognitive load, and maintain consistency.

7. **Related Products Section**  
   Added a Related Products section below the main content to encourage further exploration and increase browsing time.

## Additional Enhancements

**Fade-In Transition on Product Load**  
Implemented a smooth fade-in effect when users navigate to a product page for a more polished and engaging feel.

**Staggered Fade-In for Related Products**  
Related items now appear one by one with a subtle staggered animation to create a refined visual flow.

**Performance-Conscious Animation Choices**  
Animations and transitions were deliberately kept minimal based on e-commerce UX research to ensure fast load times and optimal performance.
